# project-euler
Simple programming challenges from projecteuler.net

Each Project Euler challenge is contained in its own class. This is somewhat cumbersome for the smaller challenges, which could be contained in its own method; however, this is to accomodate larger challeneges which may require multiple methods. Subject to change as I continue through each challenge.
