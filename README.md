# project-euler
Simple programming challenges from projecteuler.net

Each Project Euler challenge is contained in its own package. This is somewhat cumbersome for smaller challenges which could easily be contained within a single method; however, this is to accomodate for larger challenges which may require multiple classes. 

The description of each challenge is contained in the JavaDoc for each project's ProjectEulerxxx.java file, where xxx is the number of the challenge.
